# Overview


Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR), is widely used in biological research. Various analysis methods are employed on the real-time PCR data to measure the mRNA levels under different experimental conditions. I developed ‘rtpcr’ package for amplification efficiency calculation and statistical analysis of real-time PCR data in R. By accounting for up to two reference genes and amplification efficiency values, a general calculation method by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1949-5">Ganger et al. 2017</a> covering both the Livak and Pfaffl methods was used. Based on the experimental conditions, the functions of the ‘rtpcr’ package use a t-test (for experiments with a two-level factor) or analysis of variance (for cases where more than two levels or factors exist) to calculate the fold change (FC) or relative expression (RE). The functions further provide standard deviations and confidence limits for means, apply statistical mean comparisons and present letter mean grouping. To facilitate function application, different data sets were used as examples and the outputs were explained. An outstanding feature of ‘rtpcr’ package is providing publication-ready bar plots with various controlling arguments for experiments with up to three different factors. The ‘rtpcr’ package is user-friendly and easy to work with and provides an applicable resource for analyzing real-time PCR data in R. ‘rtpcr’ is a CRAN package although the development version of the package can be obtained through Github.

# Calculation methods
Among the various approaches developed for data analysis in real-time PCR, the Livak method, also known as the $2^{-\Delta\Delta C_t}$ method, stands out for its simplicity and widespread use. 


$$\begin{align*}
\text{Fold change} & = 2^{-\Delta\Delta C_t} \\
& = \frac{2^{-(C_{t_{\text{target}}}-C_{t_{\text{ref}}})_{Tr}}}
{2^{-(C_{t_{\text{target}}}-C_{t_{\text{ref}}})_{Co}}} \\ 
& =2^{-[(C_{t_{\text{target}}}-C_{t_{\text{ref}}})_{\text{Tr}}-
{(C_{t_{\text{target}}}-C_{t_{\text{ref}}})}_{\text{Co}}]} \\ 
& = 2^{-[{(\Delta C_t)_{Tr} - (\Delta C_t)_{Co}}]}
\end{align*}$$


where Tr is Treatment and Co is Control conditions, respectively. This method assumes that both the target and reference genes are amplified with efficiencies close to 100%, allowing for the relative quantification of gene expression levels¹.

On the other hand, the Pfaffl method offers a more flexible approach by accounting for differences in amplification efficiencies between the target and reference genes. This method adjusts the calculated expression ratio by incorporating the specific amplification efficiencies, thus providing a more accurate representation of the relative gene expression levels².

$$\text{Fold change} = \frac{E^{-(C_{t_{\text{Tr}}}-C_{t_{\text{Co}}})_{target}}}
{E^{-(C_{t_{\text{Tr}}}-C_{t_{\text{Co}}})_{ref}}}$$

# A generalized calculation method
the 'rtpcr' packager calculates wDCt values for each experimental condition based on the efficiency and Ct values as described by Ganger et al. (2017).


$$w\Delta Ct =\log_{10}(E_{target}).Ct_{target}-\log_{10}(E_{ref}).Ct_{ref}$$
if wDCt values are calculated using the efficiencies (E) values, calculations match the formula of Pfaffl. if 2 (100% amplification efficiency) is used, calculations match the formula of Livak. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-test (paired or unpaired) is done on the wDCt values. Subsequently, the mean of wCt over each condition along with the resulting statistics (e.g. confidence limits for the means) is converted by a power of ten-conversion for presentation. For example, relative expression is calculated as:
$$\text{Relative Expression} = 10^{-\overline{w\Delta Ct}}$$
When there are only two conditions (Tr and Co), fold change can also be calculated:

$$\text{Fold Change}=10^{-(\overline{w\Delta Ct}_{\text{Tr}}-{\overline{w\Delta Ct}_{\text{Co}}})}$$

# Amplification efficiency data analysis
## Sample data of amplification efficiency

To calculate the amplification efficiencies of a target and a reference gene, a data frame should be prepared with 3 columns of dilutions, target gene Ct values, and reference gene Ct values, respectively,  as shown below.

```{r eval= T}
data_efficiency
```


	



## Calculating amplification efficiency
The following `efficiency` function calculates the amplification efficiency of a target and a reference gene and presents the related standard curves along with the Slope, Efficiency, and R2 statistics. The function also compares the slopes of the two standard curves. For this, a regression line is fitted using the $\Delta C_t$ values. If $2^{-\Delta\Delta C_t}$ method is intended, the slope should not exceed 0.2!

```{r eval = T, fig.height = 3, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'Standard curve and the amplification efficiency analysis of target and reference genes.', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
efficiency(data_efficiency)
```

# Expression data analysis

## Target genes in two conditions (t-test)

### Example data
when a target gene is assessed under two different conditions (for example Control and treatment), it is possible to calculate the average fold change expression i.e. $2^{-\Delta \Delta C_t}$ of the target gene in treatment relative to control conditions. For this, the data should be prepared according to the following dataset consisting of 4 columns belonging to condition levels, E (efficiency), genes and Ct values, respectively. Each Ct value is the mean of technical replicates. Complete amplification efficiencies of 2 have been assumed here for all wells but the calculated efficiencies can be used instead. 

```{r eval= T, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5, fig.align = 'center'}
data_ttest
```

### Data analysis under two conditions

Here, the above data set was used for the Fold Change expression analysis of the target genes using the `qpcrTTEST` function. This function performs a t-test-based analysis of any number of genes that 
have been evaluated under control and treatment conditions. The analysis can be done for unpaired or paired conditions. The output is a table of target gene names, fold changes confidence limits, and the t.test derived p-values. The `qpcrTTEST` function includes the `var.equal` argument. When set to `FALSE`, `t.test` is performed under the unequal variances hypothesis.

```{r eval= T}
qpcrTTEST(data_ttest, 
          numberOfrefGenes = 1,
          paired = F, 
          var.equal = T)
```


### Generating plot
The `qpcrTTESTplot` function generates a bar plot of Fold Changes and confidence intervals for the target genes. the `qpcrTTESTplot` function accepts any gene name and any replicates. The `qpcrTTESTplot` function automatically puts appropriate signs of **, * on top of the plot columns based on the output p-values.


```{r eval= T, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Average Fold changes of three target genes relative to the control condition computed by unpaired t-tests. Error bars represent 95% confidence interval.", warning = F, message = F}

# Producing the plot
qpcrTTESTplot(data_ttest,
              numberOfrefGenes = 1)

# Producing the plot: specifying gene order
qpcrTTESTplot(data_ttest,
              numberOfrefGenes = 1,
              order = c("C2H2-01", "C2H2-12", "C2H2-26"),
              paired = FALSE,
              var.equal = TRUE,
              width = 0.5,
              fill = "skyblue",
              y.axis.adjust = 0,
              y.axis.by = 2,
              ylab = "Average Fold Change",
              xlab = "Gene")
```

## A target gene under more than two conditions (ANOVA)

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of factorial experiments in the frame of a completely randomized design (CRD) can be done by the `qpcrANOVA` function. ANOVA of qPCR data is suitable when there is a factor with more than two levels, or when there is more than an experimental factor. The input data set should be prepared as shown below. Factor columns should be presented first followed by biological replicates and efficiency and Ct values of target and reference genes. The example data set below (`data_3factor_a`) represents amplification efficiency and Ct values for target and reference genes under three grouping factors (two different cultivars, three drought levels, and the presence or absence of bacteria). The table can contain any number of factor columns. The factor columns should be followed by five other columns assigned to biological replicates (r), the efficiency of the target gene, Ct values of the target gene, the efficiency of the reference gene, and Ct values of the reference gene, respectively. Here, the efficiency of 2 has been used for all wells, but the calculated efficiencies can be used instead.


```{r eval= T}
# See a sample dataset
data_3factor_a
```

The `qpcrANOVA` function performs ANOVA based on both factorial arrangement and completely randomized design (CRD). For the latter, a column of treatment combinations is made first as a grouping factor followed by ANOVA. You can call the input data set along with the added wCt and treatment combinations by `qpcrANOVA`. CRD-based analysis is especially useful when post-hoc tests and mean comparisons/grouping are desired for all treatment combinations. The final results along with the ANOVA tables can be called by `qpcrANOVA`.

### Reverse ordering of the grouping letters

One may be interested in presenting the statistical mean comparison result in the frame of grouping letters. This is rather challenging because in the grouping output of mean comparisons (via the `LSD.test` function of agricolae package), means are sorted into descending order so that the largest mean, is the first in the table and "a" letter is assigned to it. If `LSD.test` is applied to the wCt means, the biggest wCt mean receives "a" letter as expected, but this value turns into the smallest mean after its reverse log transformation by  $10^{-(\Delta Ct)}$. to solve this issue, I used a function that assigns the grouping letters appropriately.

### Output table of the analysis

The `qpcrANOVA` function produces the main analysis output including mean wDCt, LCL, UCL, grouping letters, and standard deviations. The standard deviation for each mean is derived from the back-transformed raw wDCt values from biological replicates for that mean.

```{r eval= T, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
# If the data include technical replicates, means of technical replicates
# should be calculated first using meanTech function.

# Applying ANOVA analysis
qpcrANOVA(data_3factor_a,
          numberOfrefGenes = 1,
          p.adj = "none")
```

### Barplot with the (1-alpha)% confidence interval as error bars

```{r eval= T, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Average relative expression of a target gene under two different factors of genotype (with two levels) and drought (with three levels). Error bars represent standard deviations. Means (columns) lacking letters in common have significant difference at alpha = 0.05 as resulted from the `LSD.test` of agricolae package."}
# Before plotting, the result needs to be extracted as below:
res <- qpcrANOVA(data_2factor, numberOfrefGenes = 1)$Result
res

# Plot of the 'res' data with 'Genotype' as grouping factor
twoFACTORplot(res,
   x.axis.factor = Drought,
   group.factor = Genotype,
   width = 0.5,
   fill = "Greens",
   y.axis.adjust = 0.5,
   y.axis.by = 2,
   ylab = "Relative Expression",
   xlab = "Drought Levels",
   legend.position = c(0.09, 0.8),
   show.letters = TRUE)

# Plotting the same data with 'Drought' as grouping factor
twoFACTORplot(res,
   x.axis.factor = Genotype,
   group.factor = Drought,
   xlab = "Genotype",
   fill = "Blues",
   show.letters = FALSE)
```


### A three-factorial experiment example
```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Average relative expression of a target gene under three different conditions with two, two and three levels. Error bars can be standard deviation or confidence interval. Means lacking letters in common have significant difference at alpha = 0.05 resulted from the `LSD.test` of agricolae package."}
# Before plotting, the result needs to be extracted as below:
res <- qpcrANOVA(data_3factor_b, numberOfrefGenes = 1)$Result
res

# Arrange the first three colunms of the result table.
# This determines the columns order and shapes the plot output.
threeFACTORplot(res,
    arrangement = c(3, 1, 2),
    legend.position = c(0.9, 0.85),
    xlab = "condition")



threeFACTORplot(res,
   arrangement = c(1, 2, 3),
   bar.width = 0.5,
   fill = "Greys",
   xlab = "Genotype",
   ylab = "Relative Expression")


# releveling a factor levels first
res$Conc <- factor(res$Conc, levels = c("L","M","H"))
res$Type <- factor(res$Type, levels = c("S","R"))

# Producing the plot
threeFACTORplot(res,
   arrangement = c(2, 3, 1),
   bar.width = 0.5,
   fill = "Reds",
   xlab = "Drought",
   ylab = "Relative Expression",
   errorbar = "std",
   legend.title = "Genotype",
   legend.position = c(0.2, 0.8))


# When using ci as error, increase y.axis.adjust to see the plot correctly!
threeFACTORplot(res,
   arrangement = c(2, 3, 1),
   bar.width = 0.8,
   fill = "Greens",
   xlab = "Drought",
   ylab = "Relative Expression",
   errorbar = "ci",
   y.axis.adjust = 8,
   y.axis.by = 2,
   letter.position.adjust = 0.6,
   legend.title = "Genotype",
   fontsize = 12,
   legend.position = c(0.2, 0.8),
   show.letters = TRUE)
```



# Checking normality of residuals

If the residuals from a `t.test` or a `lm` object are not normally distributed, the grouping letters (deduced from the `LSD.test`) might be violated. In such cases, one could apply another data transformation to the wDCt data for ANOVA and mean comparison purposes or use non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney test (also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test), `wilcox.test()`, which is an alternative to `t.test`, or the `kruskal.test()` test which alternative to one-way analysis of variance, to test the difference between medians of the populations using independent samples. However, the `t.test` function (along with the `qpcrTTEST` function described above) includes the `var.equal` argument. When set to `FALSE`, perform `t.test` under the unequal variances hypothesis.

```{r eval= T, eval= T, , fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "QQ-plot for the normality assessment of the residuals derived from `t.test` or `lm` functions."}

residualsCRD <- qpcrANOVA(data_3factor_b, numberOfrefGenes = 1)$lmCRD$residuals
shapiro.test(residualsCRD) 
qqnorm(residualsCRD)
qqline(residualsCRD, col = "red")
```

# Mean of technical replicates
Calculating the mean of technical replicates and getting an output table appropriate for subsequent ANOVA analysis can be done using the `meanTech` function. For this, the input data set should follow the column arrangement of the following example data. Grouping columns must be specified under the `groups` argument of the `meanTech` function.

```{r eval= T, eval= T}
# See example input data frame:
data_withTechRep

# Calculating mean of technical replicates
meanTech(data_withTechRep, groups = 1:4)
