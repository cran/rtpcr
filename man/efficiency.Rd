\usage{
efficiency(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data frame}
}
\value{
A list including standard curves along with the Slope, Efficiency, and R2 statistics
}
\description{
calculation of amplification efficiency and returns standard curves and related statistics.
}
\details{
The 'efficiency' function calculates amplification efficiency of a target and a reference gene, and present the related standard curves along with the Slope, Efficiency, and R2 statistics. The function also compares the slopes of the two standard curves.
